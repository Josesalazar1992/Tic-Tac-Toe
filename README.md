# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a project for Python Institute / Netacad course

The task is to write a simple program that simulates playing Tic-Tac-Toe with the user. To make it easier, we have decided to simplify the game. Here are our rules:

- The machine (for example, the program) will play using 'X's;
- The user (for example, you) will play using 'O's;
- The first move is made by the machine - it always places an 'X' in the center of the board;
- All squares are numbered starting from 1
- The user enters their move by typing the number of the square they choose - the number must be valid, for example, an integer greater than 0 and less than 10, and it cannot be a square that is already occupied;
- The program checks if the game is over - there are four possible outcomes: the game continues, the game ends in a tie, you win, or the machine wins;
- The machine responds with its move and the game status is checked;
- No artificial intelligence has been implemented - the machine will randomly choose a square, which is enough for this game.
